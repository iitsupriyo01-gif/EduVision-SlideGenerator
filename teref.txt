Recent Developments in U.S. Tariff Policy — August 2025

U.S.–India Tariffs (50%)
On August 27, 2025, the United States implemented a 50% tariff on a wide array of Indian exports, doubling the previous 25% rate. This move was in response to India’s continued purchase of discounted Russian oil.

Affected sectors include apparel, textiles, gems and jewelry, shrimp, carpets, furniture, footwear, chemicals, and more.

The Global Trade Research Initiative projects a 70% drop in exports in the hardest-hit sectors, which could reduce U.S.-bound Indian exports by as much as 43%.

Pharmaceuticals remain exempt due to their critical role in U.S. healthcare.

Indian markets have remained fairly stable thanks to domestic reforms such as GST improvements.

U.S. officials described India’s stance as “intransigence,” and noted that relations are becoming increasingly complicated.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed hope that despite tensions, both countries will reconcile eventually.

Furniture Sector: Tariff Investigations
On August 22, 2025, President Trump announced a tariff investigation into imported furniture using a national security rationale. The review, expected to conclude within 50 days, could result in new tariffs.

Stocks of companies such as Wayfair, RH, and Williams-Sonoma fell sharply, while domestic manufacturers like La-Z-Boy saw small gains.

Industry groups criticized the move, warning it could increase consumer costs and inflation.

De-Minimis Exemption Eliminated and Postal Disruption
The U.S. ended the long-standing “de-minimis” exemption, which had allowed imports valued under 800 dollars to enter duty-free.

Mexico suspended postal shipments to the U.S. due to confusion over the new rules.

Other disruptions occurred across Europe, Japan, Australia, and elsewhere.

The Universal Postal Union has raised concerns. New tariffs may range from 10% to 50%, or flat fees of 80 to 200 dollars per package, for at least six months.

Broader Economic Effects of Tariffs
A study from Yale’s Budget Lab highlights the wider impact of the new tariff regime:

The U.S. effective tariff rate rose by 15 to 16 percentage points, reaching levels not seen since the 1930s.

Consumers may face a 1.5 to 1.8% price increase, equal to a short-run household income loss of around 2,100 to 2,400 dollars.

Real GDP growth is projected to slow by about 0.5 percentage points in both 2025 and 2026, with unemployment rising by up to 0.7 percentage points.

The impact is regressive: the poorest households could lose 3.5% of their income, while the richest households may lose around 1%.
